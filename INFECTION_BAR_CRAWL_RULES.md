## Game Mechanics

### How Infection Spreads

An **Infected player** can spread infection by:

2. **Winning the Challenge** — If Infected wins, the Uninfected player becomes Infected
3. **Physical Tag** (Optional) — Infected can tag Uninfected to spread infection instantly
4. **Shared Drink** — If an Infected player shares a drink with Uninfected, Uninfected becomes Infected

### Infection Immunity

Uninfected players can **avoid infection** by:
- **Winning a challenge** against Infected player
- **Evading tag** (if tag rule is active)
- **Staying isolated** from Infected players
- **Protective shot** — Pay $1-2 to the pot for temporary 10-minute immunity

### Challenge Types

- Arm wrestling
- Drinking race (beer/shot)
- Push-up/sit-up contest

### Challenge Resolution

**If Infected challenges Uninfected:**
- Infected proposes challenge

## FAQ

**Q: What if everyone is Infected?**
A: Game ends. Last person to become Infected is the Patient Zero (winner). Everyone else loses.

**Q: Can I refuse a challenge?**
A: Yes. You keep your status but lose the chance to win/defend yourself.

**Q: What if two people challenge each other simultaneously?**
A: Play rock/paper/scissors to decide who challenges first, or have them both play the same challenge and both outcomes apply.

**Q: How long should the game last?**
A: 4-6 hours (typical bar crawl duration). Game ends when you leave the last bar or reach a time limit (midnight, 2 AM, etc.).

**Q: Can I go back to being Uninfected after losing to an Infected player?**
A: Only if you win a challenge against someone who is currently Infected.

**Q: What about bathroom breaks?**
A: Bathroom breaks don't reset infection status. You keep whatever status you had.
